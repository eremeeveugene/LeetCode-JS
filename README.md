# LeetCode JS Solutions

## Overview

Welcome to my collection of LeetCode solutions, all written in JavaScript. Each solution is developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD), with a focus on the AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) testing pattern. By writing tests first, I ensure my code is both reliable and efficient, minimizing bugs and verifying that each solution meets its expected outcome. This disciplined approach is ideal for solving algorithmic challenges where accuracy and performance are key.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to improve my own skills and demonstrate my capabilities. I am focused on my growth and learning by providing efficient and well-tested solutions to a wide range of LeetCode problems.

## Time and Space Complexity

I analyze the time and space complexity using Big O notation for every solution. This analysis helps me understand each solution's efficiency and scalability.
