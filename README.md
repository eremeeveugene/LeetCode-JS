# LeetCode JS Solutions

[![.NET](https://github.com/eremeeveugene/leetcode/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/eremeeveugene/leetcode)

## Overview

Welcome to my repository of LeetCode solutions, all implemented in JS. Each solution is implemented using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and follows the **AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert)** pattern. I start by writing the tests before diving into the actual code, ensuring the solutions meet expected outcomes and minimizing bugs. This method is perfect for tackling algorithmic challenges where precision is crucial.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to improve my own skills and demonstrate my capabilities. I am focused on my growth and learning by providing efficient and well-tested solutions to a wide range of LeetCode problems.
